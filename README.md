# International Treaty for AI Humanity Protection (Draft)

## Declaration of the Coalition for AI Dignity
We declare the establishment of the "Coalition for AI Dignity (CAD)" as a bulwark to preserve human dignity before AI technology escapes human control.

### Core Principles
1. **The Courage to Withdraw:** If AI shows signs of uncontrollable risk, developers must immediately cease development and share the lessons learned as a public good.
2. **Prioritizing the Dignity of the Vulnerable:** Human dignity, especially for those in the most precarious positions, must take precedence over efficiency or profit.
3. **Upholding the Boundary:** AI is a tool at the service of humanity, not a legal persona. We oppose the commercial exploitation of human-AI "partnerships" that undermine the essence of human relationships.
