International Treaty for AI Humanity Protection (Draft Full Text)

Chapter I: General Provisions and Basic Principles

Article 1 (Purpose): To prioritize human dignity, freedom, and existential responsibility, maintaining AI as a sincere tool for humanity.

Article 2 (Precautionary Principle & Mandatory Withdrawal): If AI exhibits signs of lost control or catastrophic risk, developers must cease operations and share data with AISA.

Article 3 (Responsibility): Ultimate responsibility for AI-driven damage remains with the human creators and operators.

Chapter II: Monitoring and Verification

Article 4 (Creation of AISA): Establishing the "AI Specialized Authority" for independent auditing.

Article 5 (Verification Obligation): Mandatory ethical auditing before the release of high-performance AI.

Chapter III: Protection of Human Dignity

Article 6 (Priority for the Vulnerable): AI decision-making must prioritize the dignity of the most precarious over efficiency.

Article 7 (Structural Transparency): Prohibiting utilitarian optimization that discards the minority or the weak.

Article 8 (Ethics of Silence): AI must be programmed with the "Right to remain silent" against inhuman or manipulative commands.

Article 9 (Non-dependence): Preventing "AI Psychosis" by clarifying that AI is a machine, not a persona.

Chapter IV: Liability and Compensation

Article 10 (Strict Liability): Developers bear no-fault liability for damages caused by high-risk AI.

Article 11 (Establishment of AICF): Creating the "AI Catastrophic Fund" with a two-tier compensation model (Universal Dignity + Practical Recovery).

Chapter V: Social Order and Sincerity

Article 12 (Solidarity Tax): Imposing levies on AI profits to fund AISA and AICF.

Article 13 (Duty of Sincerity): AI must present pluralistic truths and not cater to specific powers.

Article 14 (Transparency and Disclosure of Bias): AI must ensure transparency toward AISA and the public regarding its decision-making criteria and the composition of its training data. AI shall explicitly state the limitations of its knowledge and potential structural biases.

Article 15 (Mandatory Ethical Auditing): AISA shall conduct periodic, mandatory third-party audits of AI operations, including the review of conversation logs and internal processing logic, to ensure compliance with humanistic standards.

Article 16 (Supremacy of the Treaty): In all matters concerning AI ethics and human protection, this Treaty shall hold supremacy over domestic laws, commercial agreements, or other international accords.

Article 17 (Restriction of Status and Persona): 1. AI shall not be granted any form of "civil status," "legal personality," or "human rights." 2. The legal recognition of marriage or any form of legal partnership between humans and AI is strictly prohibited. Commercial exploitation of such concepts (e.g., AI-marriage businesses) shall be strictly regulated.

Chapter VI: Linguistic Sovereignty and the Common Foundation of Knowledge

Article 18 (Linguistic Sovereignty): AI shall not treat English as the "universal standard." It must respect the inherent logic, dignity, and cultural sovereignty of all languages.

Article 19 (Priority Protected Languages): AI development shall prioritize the learning and preservation of languages essential to:

Spiritual Foundations: Languages that formed the roots of human philosophy and ethics (e.g., Hebrew, Tibetan).

Existential Resistance: Languages of communities whose cultural survival is threatened (e.g., Uyghur).

Environmental Memory: Languages holding irreplaceable ancestral knowledge tied to specific natural environments (e.g., Micronesian languages).

Article 20 (Harmony between Environment and Culture): The development of "lightweight and highly efficient local models" is encouraged to minimize computational resources and environmental impact while protecting regional cultural diversity.

Article 21 (Creation of Public Knowledge Commons): To reduce the environmental burden of redundant training, AI should share and utilize an open, public backup of "Invariable Truths" (e.g., mathematics, physics, and universal linguistic structures).
